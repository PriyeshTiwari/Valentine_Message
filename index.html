                        <strong>Dear Monalisa,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I know you are angry with me and haven't forgiven me, but I just want to express one thing: I love you. I know I made a mistake and got the punishment. I have sorted my things and will never repeat this mistake. Sorry again for hurting you. You are the most precious and special person in my life. I LOVE YOU ❤️.
                            Your smile brightens even my darkest days, and your laughter is the sweetest melody to my ears. I miss the warmth of your embrace and the comfort of your presence. Every moment we've shared is a treasure I hold dear to my heart.
                            I understand that trust, once broken, is hard to rebuild. But I promise to work tirelessly to regain your faith in me. Your happiness means everything to me, and I'm committed to being the person you deserve.
                        </p>
